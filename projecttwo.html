<h1>Algorithms and Data Structure</h1>
This artifact is from my class CS-260, or Data Structures and Algorithms. We were tasked with creating a binary
    search tree, a hash table, a linked list, and a vector list in C++. The function of these programs was to simulate
    an auction program, which included features like adding and removing bids and a bid timer. This project showed my
    ability to not only use C++, but also include many features in the same document.
    <h3>- Enhancements</h3>
    Going through each document, I was having difficulty finding a way to make the program more efficient. While looking
    through the project, I noticed that there were a lot of unnecessary lines that were either blank in places that they
    didn’t need to be or were in comments that were just fluff (only had * or */). To improve on this artifact, I was
    able to delete 75+ lines from each of the 5 documents in this file. This increased the speed when it’s compiled by
    at least one second and considering the use of the documents (Auction list and bidding), time is of the essence.
    <p>
      After rereading the programs, I realized something. “Why have 5 different programs when the bulk of the code is
      the same?” So, I made a new project, combining all the programs into one program. Although there are still a few
      errors showing up that I have been unable to fix, I believe the code should be sound. The errors mainly are being
      seen in some places, while the same terms in other places are not “errored”. I’ve encountered this a few times and
      it might just be an IDE or copy / paste issue with Microsoft Visual Studio. Outside of those issues, combining the
      programs was not a huge issue as most of the programs were the same and the different parts in each code easily
      combined with the others.
