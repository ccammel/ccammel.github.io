    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>When I started my journey into Computer Science, I quickly wondered what I had gotten myself into. Learning so many languages that were my own, but foreign all at the same time. There were times when I was learning everything that it just clicked, and I understood. On the flip side, there were times that I spent my nights Googling as much as I could until I found an answer for what I was trying to accomplish. I’ve experienced love, hate, gain, and loss in my personal life throughout my learning. When I was at my lowest, there was nothing I wanted to do more than quit school, but there’s one thing I did instead: I persevered. </p> <p>I learned how to properly design and engineer a program, as shown in Project One. When enhancing the same project, I demonstrated my ability to alter a program to work in a different language, in this case Java to C++. During Project Two, I showed my confidence in structuring data and algorithms to work together in the proper manner. As I enhanced Project Two, I exhibited my ability to combine programs and increase their efficiency. With Project Three, I put together a secure database using SQL. After enhancing Project Three, I proved my capability to create a MongoDB interface with JavaScript, altering a program to work with another program effectively. In my video section, I show not only my ability to execute a code review, but I also show where my passion is: Game Programming. Here, I show my capacity to work well in a team environment as well as showing off a product with the requirements given to us from a would-be customer.</p>
<p>My portfolio is a dedication to my fight through everything to show that I have what it takes to make it in the world of programming. Some classes were a walk in the park. Others, I fought, clawed, and pushed my way through until I passed. Continually fighting until the assignment is complete. I persevered through all of my trials until I finally made it through.</p>
