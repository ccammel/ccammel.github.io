    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>When I started this journey, I never thought I’d end up where I’m hoping to be. I knew that this would be a long adventure, and after five and a half years of sleepless nights, frustrations, and triumphs, the culmination of my education is here. The following is a collection of works that I’m most proud of, the enhancements I did to them, and finally, a self-assessment of my endeavors.</p> <p>Another project to consider is this website itself. Prior to writing all the code for it, I had no HTML or CSS knowledge. I'm extremely proud of how well I made this look with the lack of knowledge I had a week prior to beginning this site.</p>
