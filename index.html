  <h1><center>Chris Cammel's Coding Journey</center></h1>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  When I started this journey, I never thought I’d end up where I’m hoping to be. I knew that this would be a long adventure, and after five and a half years of sleepless nights, frustrations, and triumphs, the culmination of my education is here. The following is a collection of works that I’m most proud of, the enhancements I did to them, and finally, a self-assessment of my endeavors.
  <h3>Project One – Software Design and Engineering</h3>
  The artifact that I’m using for this enhancement is from CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. In this class, we used Java to create a program to set up a list of contacts to include a contact ID, first name, last name, phone number, and address. 
<p>
  I have included this project because not only is it the only Java project in my long list of projects I have completed, but it’s one of the projects I was most proud of. Java is one of the more used programming languages in the world, so including even a simple program can show that I know the basics. The reason that I’m proud of this project is because when I first worked on it, I didn’t need as much help as I first thought I would need. I was able to write the entire project using about 80 percent personal knowledge, and the other 20 percent being my knowledge of Google searching.
  <h3>- Enhancements</h3>
  To enhance this project, I rewrote the entire project in C++. With C++ being a primary language, I want to focus on in my career, I felt that converting from Java was going to be an easier step than it was. Overall, the new project took me a couple of days and more than a few Google searches. The toughest thing was the overall translation of the two programming languages since they are not an exact one to one. 
  <h3>Project Two – Algorithms and Data Structure</h3>
  This artifact is from my class CS-260, or Data Structures and Algorithms. We were tasked with creating a binary search tree, a hash table, a linked list, and a vector list in C++. The function of these programs was to simulate an auction program, which included features like adding and removing bids and a bid timer. This project showed my ability to not only use C++, but also include many features in the same document.
  <h3>- Enhancements</h3>
  Going through each document, I was having difficulty finding a way to make the program more efficient. While looking through the project, I noticed that there were a lot of unnecessary lines that were either blank in places that they didn’t need to be or were in comments that were just fluff (only had * or */). To improve on this artifact, I was able to delete 75+ lines from each of the 5 documents in this file. This increased the speed when it’s compiled by at least one second and considering the use of the documents (Auction list and bidding), time is of the essence.
<p>
  After rereading the programs, I realized something. “Why have 5 different programs when the bulk of the code is the same?” So, I made a new project, combining all the programs into one program. Although there are still a few errors showing up that I have been unable to fix, I believe the code should be sound. The errors mainly are being seen in some places, while the same terms in other places are not “errored”. I’ve encountered this a few times and it might just be an IDE or copy / paste issue with Microsoft Visual Studio. Outside of those issues, combining the programs was not a huge issue as most of the programs were the same and the different parts in each code easily combined with the others.
  <h3>Project Three - Databases</h3>
  For the Databases portion of the project, I chose to use an SQL project. This specific project was from DAD-220: Introduction to SQL. I decided to include this artifact because it was my most complete assignment that had anything to do with databases.
  <h3>- Enhancements</h3>
  With this project, I decided to create a MongoDB interface with JavaScript. The reason I went with this enhancement is because a lot of times, a database being easily shown on a website is difficult in its raw form. Having the ability to look at data in a uniform manner is pleasing to the eye and less of a headache, especially if it is searchable and sortable.
<p>
  I believe I was able to meet the course objectives by creating a MongoDB interface with JavaScript from this artifact. It wasn’t easy by any means, but I learned a lot more about JavaScript, SQL, and MongoDB. The biggest challenge I found was figuring out the different translations and how to connect the database with JavaScript and MongoDB.
