  <h1>Software Design and Engineering</h1>

    The artifact that I’m using for this enhancement is from CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality
    Assurance. In this class, we used Java to create a program to set up a list of contacts to include a contact ID,
    first name, last name, phone number, and address.
    <p>
      I have included this project because not only is it the only Java project in my long list of projects I have
      completed, but it’s one of the projects I was most proud of. Java is one of the more used programming languages in
      the world, so including even a simple program can show that I know the basics. The reason that I’m proud of this
      project is because when I first worked on it, I didn’t need as much help as I first thought I would need. I was
      able to write the entire project using about 80 percent personal knowledge, and the other 20 percent being my
      knowledge of Google searching.
    <h3>- Enhancements</h3>
    To enhance this project, I rewrote the entire project in C++. With C++ being a primary language, I want to focus on
    in my career, I felt that converting from Java was going to be an easier step than it was. Overall, the new project
    took me a couple of days and more than a few Google searches. The toughest thing was the overall translation of the
    two programming languages since they are not an exact one to one.
