<h1>Databases</h1>
    <!--- Code Block --->
    <div>
      <code class="language-sql">
          <object height= "300px" width="100%" data="assets/Code examples/Project Three/Final Code.sql">
          </object>
       </code>
    </div>
    <p>
    For the Databases portion of the project, I chose to use an SQL project. This specific project was from DAD-220:
    Introduction to SQL. I decided to include this artifact because it was my most complete assignment that had anything
    to do with databases.

    <h3>- Enhancements</h3>
    <!--- Code Block --->
    <div>
      <code class="language-sql">
          <object height= "300px" width="100%" data="assets/Code enhancements/Project Three/SQL to JS.js">
          </object>
       </code>
    </div>
    <p>
    With this project, I decided to create a MongoDB interface with JavaScript. The reason I went with this enhancement
    is because a lot of times, a database being easily shown on a website is difficult in its raw form. Having the
    ability to look at data in a uniform manner is pleasing to the eye and less of a headache, especially if it is
    searchable and sortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe I was able to meet the course objectives by creating a MongoDB interface with JavaScript from this
      artifact. It wasnâ€™t easy by any means, but I learned a lot more about JavaScript, SQL, and MongoDB. The biggest
      challenge I found was figuring out the different translations and how to connect the database with JavaScript and
      MongoDB.
